# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS) is a local, CLI-based hierarchical AI agent framework that coordinates multiple Large Language Models (Claude, Gemini, GPT) to execute complex projects. The system mimics a software development team structure with specialized agents working under a project management hierarchy to decompose, delegate, and execute tasks while managing context and token usage across multiple models.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Current Limitations:
- Single LLM approaches hit context window limits on large projects
- API-based solutions incur high costs and require internet connectivity
- Monolithic AI agents lack specialization for different task types
- No effective way to leverage multiple LLMs' unique strengths in concert
- Difficult to track and visualize AI agent progress on complex projects

### User Pain Points:
- Running out of context when tackling large development projects
- Inability to use the best model for each specific task type
- Lack of visibility into AI reasoning and task execution
- No way to pause/resume long-running AI projects
- Inefficient token usage with single-model approaches

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW

A hierarchical multi-agent system that:
- Distributes project workload across specialized AI agents
- Uses different LLMs for their strengths (Claude for coding, Gemini for research, GPT for planning)
- Manages context by partitioning information to relevant agents only
- Provides real-time visualization of agent activities and progress
- Runs entirely locally using CLI tools without API dependencies
- Supports pause/resume functionality for long-running projects

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features:

#### Hierarchical Agent Structure
- Project Manager (PM) agent for high-level planning and orchestration
- Team Lead agents for domain-specific task management
- Specialist Worker agents for task execution
- Dynamic team activation based on project needs

#### Multi-Model Integration
- Support for Claude (via claude-code CLI)
- Support for Gemini (via gemini CLI)
- Support for GPT/Codex (via gpt CLI or alternative)
- Model selection based on task type and complexity
- Fallback mechanisms for model failures

#### Task Management
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based task planning
- Dependency tracking and resolution
- Sequential execution with future parallel capability
- Task status tracking (queued, in-progress, complete, failed)

#### Context Management
- Intelligent context partitioning per agent
- Context summarization for long-running projects
- Artifact storage and retrieval system
- Inter-agent communication via shared state

#### State Persistence
- JSON-based state storage
- Project checkpointing
- Resume from interruption
- Complete audit trail of all agent actions

#### Monitoring and Visualization
- Real-time project status dashboard
- Agent hierarchy visualization
- Task progress tracking
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Error and retry visualization

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance:
- Single task execution time: <5 minutes for simple tasks
- Project completion: Within reasonable time for complexity (hours for large projects acceptable)
- State save frequency: After each task completion
- CLI timeout handling: 5-minute default, configurable per task type

### Reliability:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks
- Graceful degradation when specific models unavailable
- State corruption prevention via atomic writes

### Usability:
- Single command project initiation
- Clear progress indicators during execution
- Intuitive web dashboard for monitoring
- Comprehensive error messages with suggested fixes

### Scalability:
- Support for projects with 100+ tasks
- Ability to add new agent types without core changes
- Configurable model routing rules
- Extensible prompt template system

### Security:
- No external API calls or data transmission
- Local file system artifact storage
- No automatic code execution without review
- Sanitized file paths to prevent directory traversal

## USER STORIES

- As a developer, I want to give the system a complex project description and have it automatically break down and execute the work using appropriate specialists.
- As a user, I want to see real-time progress of my AI agents working on tasks so I can understand what's happening and intervene if needed.
- As a power user, I want to pause a long-running project and resume it later without losing progress.
- As a developer, I want the system to use Claude for complex coding tasks and Gemini for research tasks to get the best results from each model.
- As a user, I want to review all generated artifacts before any code is executed to ensure safety and correctness.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Layer Structure:
- **Orchestration Layer:** Main controller and state management
- **Agent Layer:** PM, Team Leads, and Worker agents
- **Provider Layer:** CLI wrappers for each LLM
- **Storage Layer:** File system based state and artifacts
- **Interface Layer:** CLI and web dashboard

### Component Interaction:
- Synchronous task execution within teams
- Asynchronous state updates to dashboard
- File-based artifact passing between agents
- JSON-based inter-agent communication

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Technology Stack:
- **Core:** Python 3.8+
- **CLI Integration:** subprocess, wrapper scripts
- **Web Dashboard:** HTML/JavaScript with WebSocket or polling
- **State Storage:** JSON files with structured schema
- **Supported OS:** Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS

### Dependencies:
- Python standard library
- Optional: FastAPI for web server
- Optional: Rich for terminal UI
- Node.js for Claude CLI wrapper
- PowerShell for Windows automation

## CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS

- Sequential execution only in v1 (no parallel tasks)
- CLI-based integration requires wrapper scripts
- Context window management must be manual
- No automatic code execution for safety
- Limited to local machine resources
- Token/cost tracking is estimated, not actual

## SUCCESS METRICS

- Successfully complete multi-file development projects
- Reduce token usage by 40% vs single-model approach
- Complete projects that exceed single model context limits
- Maintain 95% task success rate after retries
- User satisfaction with progress visibility

## RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| CLI tools change interface | Wrapper abstraction layer, version pinning |
| Context overflow on complex projects | Automatic summarization, context pruning |
| Model-specific failures | Fallback routing, retry mechanisms |
| State corruption | Atomic writes, backup states, validation |

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Phase 2:
- Parallel task execution for independent work
- Vector database for project memory
- Automated quality assurance agents
- Real-time collaborative features

### Phase 3:
- Learned orchestration via reinforcement learning
- Custom fine-tuned specialist models
- Integration with external tools and APIs
- Multi-user support with access controls
