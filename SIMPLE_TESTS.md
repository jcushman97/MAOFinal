# Simple Tests for MAOS System

## Quick Test Instructions

### Test 1: Basic System Validation ✅
**Purpose**: Verify system initializes and basic functionality works
```bash
python simple_test.py
```
**Expected Result**: All 6 tests should PASS with 100% success rate

### Test 2: End-to-End Project Execution ✅  
**Purpose**: Test complete project execution with the fix applied
```bash
python main.py "Simple HTML page with title and paragraph"
```
**Expected Result**: 
- Project should create 3-4 tasks
- All tasks should complete (100% completion rate)
- Project status should be "complete" not "failed"
- Should see multiple tasks executed sequentially

### Test 3: Parallel System Configuration ✅
**Purpose**: Verify all parallel execution modes work
```bash
python test_parallel_system.py
```
**Expected Result**: All parallel strategies (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive) should initialize correctly

### Test 4: Fix Validation ✅
**Purpose**: Verify the sequential execution fix is working
```bash
python test_fix.py
```
**Expected Result**: Should show validation successful with explanation of the fix

## What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- **Task Completion**: All created tasks complete (not just 1 out of 6)
- **Project Status**: "complete" instead of "failed"  
- **Completion Rate**: 100% instead of 16.7%
- **No Errors**: No critical errors or exceptions

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
- Project completing with only 1 task done
- "Project failed to complete" message
- Low completion rates (16.7%, 33%, etc.)
- System stopping early

## Recent Fix Applied

**Issue Found**: System was only completing 1 out of 6 tasks (16.7% completion rate)

**Root Cause**: The parallel orchestrator's sequential execution method was missing an iteration loop to continue processing tasks until all complete.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper iteration loop in sequential execution
- System now processes all tasks until 100% completion
- Maintains backward compatibility with Phases 1-3

**Result**: System now completes all tasks dynamically for any project configuration.

## Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# Test all system phases
python simple_test.py

# Test real project execution  
python main.py "Create a simple website"

# Test parallel configurations
python test_parallel_system.py

# Validate the fix
python test_fix.py

# Test in dry-run mode (no Claude API calls)
python main.py "Any project description" --dry-run
```

## Expected Timeline

Each test should complete in:
- **simple_test.py**: <5 seconds
- **test_parallel_system.py**: <5 seconds  
- **test_fix.py**: <5 seconds
- **main.py --dry-run**: <5 seconds
- **main.py (full)**: 2-10 minutes depending on project complexity

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:
1. Check that you're in the correct directory (`maoFinal`)
2. Ensure Python dependencies are installed
3. Check that the fix was applied correctly by running `test_fix.py`
4. Review the git commit history to confirm the fix is present

The system is now working correctly according to the original PRD specifications.
