--------------------------------------------------
The HTML structure has been enhanced with:
- Added aria-required attributes to form inputs
- Converted div-based list to semantic ul/li elements
- Added gallery-grid class for styling
- Maintained all existing ARIA roles and labels

The structure is now more semantic and accessible while maintaining the original content organization.
