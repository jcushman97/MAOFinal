I notice I don't have write permissions. Let me provide the code that I've created, which sets up:

1. A centered container for 5 color boxes
2. A generate button above the color scheme
3. Clean, modern styling with hover effects
4. Responsive layout
5. Basic structure ready for JavaScript color generation

The code is complete and ready to be saved as index.html. The next step would be to add JavaScript functionality for generating and applying random colors.
