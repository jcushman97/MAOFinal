I need permission to write to the file system to create and modify the HTML file. Please grant the necessary permissions to proceed with the implementation. The code I've prepared includes:

1. A styled button for generating color schemes
2. A click handler that generates random colors
3. A display area for showing 5 color boxes
4. Initial color scheme generation on page load

Once permissions are granted, I can implement these features and you'll have a working color scheme generator.
