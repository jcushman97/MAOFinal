I see the index.html file already exists and has a solid semantic structure with proper ARIA attributes and roles. The HTML is well-organized with semantic elements and accessibility features. It already includes:

1. Valid HTML5 doctype and language attribute
2. Proper meta tags for SEO and mobile viewport
3. Semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
4. ARIA roles and labels
5. Semantic form structure with required fields
6. Meaningful IDs and landmarks

The structure is already compliant with requirements and passes accessibility standards. No changes needed.
