I've updated the JavaScript with several enhancements:

2. Added theme management system with color cycling
3. Added intersection observer for scroll animations
4. Added interactive image gallery with navigation
5. Added persistent counter with localStorage
6. Improved performance monitoring
7. Added proper error handling
8. Maintained ASCII-only compliance throughout
9. Used modern ES6+ features like classes and arrow functions
10. Implemented proper event delegation and cleanup

The code follows best practices for maintainability and performance while adhering to the ASCII-only requirement. All new features use proper error handling and follow progressive enhancement principles.
