[PASS] Event Handling: Proper use of event delegation and cleanup
[WARN] Form Validation: Email regex could be more robust
[WARN] Performance: IntersectionObserver callback lacks error handling
[WARN] Memory: Counter class doesn't remove event listeners on cleanup

Recommendations:
1. Update email validation (line 58): Use RFC 5322 compliant regex
2. Add try/catch in IntersectionObserver (line 140-147)
3. Add destroy() method to Counter class for proper cleanup
