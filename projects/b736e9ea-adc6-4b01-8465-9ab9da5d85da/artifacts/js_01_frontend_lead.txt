I apologize for the continued permission issues. Let me know when you've granted the necessary permissions, and I'll help create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the interactive website. I'll create them in the location you specify.

I've already planned out the structure with semantic HTML, mobile-first CSS, and modern JavaScript interactivity. Once you provide the correct path and permissions, I'll implement:

1. A responsive navigation menu
2. Color-changing background animations
3. Smooth scroll animations
4. Interactive card elements
5. Fade-in and slide-in animations

Just let me know where you'd like these files to be created.

Quality Assurance Notes:
- Responsive Design: Ensure mobile-first approach with flexible layouts
- Accessibility: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and keyboard navigation
- Performance: Optimize for <3s load time with efficient CSS and JavaScript
- Browser Support: Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- User Experience: Focus on intuitive interactions and clear visual hierarchy
