I see I don't have the necessary permissions to write files. Let me summarize what I've prepared:

1. A mobile-first CSS structure using:
- CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Relative units (rem, em, %) for typography
- CSS Custom Properties for maintainability
- Breakpoints at 768px, 1024px, 1200px, and 1440px
- Touch-friendly sizing (44px minimum)

2. Playwright tests to validate:
- Responsive behavior across viewports
- Touch target sizes
- Grid layout changes
- Image scaling
- Portrait/landscape orientations

Would you like me to provide the code in a different format, or would you like me to focus on specific aspects of the responsive implementation?

Quality Assurance Notes:
- Responsive Design: Ensure mobile-first approach with flexible layouts
- Accessibility: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and keyboard navigation
- Performance: Optimize for <3s load time with efficient CSS and JavaScript
- Browser Support: Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- User Experience: Focus on intuitive interactions and clear visual hierarchy
